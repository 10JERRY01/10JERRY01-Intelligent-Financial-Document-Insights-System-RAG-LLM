# Intelligent Financial Document Insights System - Project Documentation

## Overview
The **Intelligent Financial Document Insights System** is an AI-powered tool designed to process, analyze, and query financial documents (e.g., annual reports). It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a large language model (LLM) to extract trends and provide natural language answers to user queries. Built with Python, this project demonstrates skills in data science, machine learning, and visualizationâ€”tailored to financial applications.

## Objectives
- Extract and preprocess text from financial PDFs.
- Analyze document content to identify key trends (e.g., frequent terms).
- Enable intelligent querying using RAG and an LLM.
- Present insights through visualizations and an interactive interface.

## Features
1. **PDF Processing**: Extracts and cleans text from financial PDFs.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies top words and trends with statistical summaries.
3. **AI-Powered Querying**: Uses RAG and an LLM to answer questions based on document content.
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays EDA visuals and query responses via Streamlit.


## Technical Details
### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `PyPDF2`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `transformers`, `streamlit`, `torch`

### Workflow
1. **Data Pipeline** (`pdf_processor.py`):
   - Input: Financial PDF (e.g., JPMorgan Chase 2023 Annual Report).
   - Process: Extract text, clean noise, save as CSV.
2. **EDA** (`eda.py`):
   - Tokenize text, calculate word frequencies, visualize top 10 terms.
3. **RAG + LLM** (`rag_llm.py`):
   - Chunk text, generate embeddings with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, index with FAISS.
   - Query with RAG, generate answers using `distilgpt2`.
4. **Interface** (`app.py`):
   - Streamlit app combining EDA visuals and query functionality.

## Limitations
- **LLM Quality**: `distilgpt2` provides basic answers; larger models could improve accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Single-document focus; multi-document support requires extension.
- **Text Extraction**: Complex PDFs may yield imperfect text due to formatting.

## Future Enhancements
- Upgrade to a stronger LLM (e.g., GPT-3 via API).
- Add multi-document processing and comparison.
- Enhance UI with additional visualizations (e.g., word clouds).
